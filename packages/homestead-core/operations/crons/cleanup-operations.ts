/**
 * `operations-cleanup` cron handler.
 *
 * Finished operations (`done: true`) are never otherwise deleted, so the
 * `operations` collection grows unbounded — one record per async method,
 * bulk import, and cron firing. This job runs daily (and once on boot) and
 * deletes every finished operation whose `create_time` is older than the
 * retention window, keeping the collection bounded. Still-running operations
 * are always left alone; the boot-time `sweepStaleOperations` is what rescues
 * those, not this.
 *
 * Lists the full collection and filters in memory — mirroring
 * `sweepStaleOperations` — rather than pushing predicates down as a server-side
 * filter. (`create_time` isn't filterable anyway: it's one of aepbase's
 * STANDARD_FIELDS, which the engine excludes from its filter grammar.)
 *
 * Server-only: lives under `crons/`, so vite stubs it out of the browser
 * bundle. Runs headless with a short-lived admin token from the scheduler.
