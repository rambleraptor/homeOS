 * for rapid/unawaited calls) and enqueues one `updateMetadata` write that runs
 * strictly after the previous one — no two writes for the same operation are
 * ever in flight at once, and they land in call order. Each write is wrapped in
 * try/catch so a persistence failure neither rejects the chain nor propagates
 * to the caller.

 * the server cron scheduler and the (Bun/Node/test) custom-method dispatcher can
 * use it without dragging in server-only imports.
