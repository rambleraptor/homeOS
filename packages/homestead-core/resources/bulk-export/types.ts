/**
 * Bulk export contract (AEP-136 custom method `<plural>:bulk-export`).
 *
 * The mirror image of {@link ../bulk-import/types bulk import}. A resource opts
 * in by declaring `bulkExport` on its {@link ResourceDefinition}; the registry
 * synthesizes the custom method from that declaration, so an app never
 * hand-writes a handler, a route, or a page — it lists the file formats it can
 * be exported to and (optionally) how the rows are fetched.
 *
 * Where bulk import runs `parse → save` (bytes in, records written), bulk export
 * runs `source → serialize` (records read, bytes out):
 *
 *   import:  file  ──parser──▶  rows  ──saver──▶   collection writes
 *   export:  query ──source──▶  rows  ──serializer──▶ file
 *
 * Fetching and serializing both run server-side, so the browser, the CLI
 * (`homestead resources <plural> bulk-export`), and any REST caller all drive
 * the same code path. Unlike import (a POST that spawns an AEP-151 operation),
 * export is a plain **GET** that streams the file back with a
 * `Content-Disposition` attachment header — a download is a read, so it needs
 * neither a request body nor progress polling.
 *
 * @example
 *   bulkExport: {
 *     formats: [
 *       {
 *         id: 'csv',
 *         label: 'CSV',
 *         mimeType: 'text/csv',
 *         extension: 'csv',
 *         load: () => import('./methods/bulk-export-csv'),
 *       },
 *     ],
 *   }
