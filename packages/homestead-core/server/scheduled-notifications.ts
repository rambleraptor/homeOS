/**
 * Scheduling notifications for a future instant.
 *
 * This is the producer side of the delivery queue. Nothing here sends anything
 * — it writes rows under `/users/{id}/scheduled-notifications`, and the
 * dispatcher cron (`notifications/crons/dispatch.ts`) delivers whatever has
 * come due. One place decides *what* to say and when; one place decides *how*
 * to say it.
 *
 * Two kinds of caller:
 *
 * - **Ad-hoc**, via {@link scheduleNotification}: something happened, tell this
 *   person about it later. Fire and forget.
 * - **Reconciling**, via {@link reconcileScheduled}: an app owns records that
 *   imply notifications (an event a week out, tomorrow's bin night, a perk
 *   window closing) and re-derives the whole set on a daily cron. Because that
 *   cron runs over an overlapping horizon, it can't create blindly — it hands
 *   over the full plan and this module makes the stored rows match.
 *
 * The reconciling contract is a `source_key` per planned notification: an
 * app-unique, stable string identifying *what the notification is for*
 * (`<event id>:day_of:2026`, `pickup:2026-08-25`). It must be derived from the
 * source record, never from the clock — it is the only thing standing between
 * one notification and seven copies of it.
 *
 * Server-only. Runs under the short-lived admin token a cron or migration is
 * given, which is what lets it write into another user's subtree
 * (`checkUserScope` denies that to everyone else).

 * | in plan, row is `sent`/`canceled`/`missed`/`failed`      | leave     |
 * | not in plan, row is `scheduled` with a future `send_at`  | withdraw  |

 *
 * Two invariants hold this together.
 *
 * **Only past rows are pruned.** A plan only ever contains future keys, so a
 * cancelled row can never be resurrected while its moment is still ahead: by
 * the time prune removes it, its key is out of the horizon. Sweeping on age
 * alone would let "no, not this week's bin night" come back.
 *
 * **A moved date is a patch, not a re-announce.** Patching an unsent row's
 * `send_at` moves the delivery; once sent, the row is settled and reconcile
 * leaves it alone. A producer that *wants* "the date moved, say so again" folds
 * the instant into its `source_key` — which is what every key in this repo
 * already does.
