/**
 * Resource syncs — best-effort, one-way mirroring of a resource's records to an
 * external system after they change.
 *
 * An app declares `syncs: ResourceSync[]` on its {@link AppConfig}; each entry
 * names the resource it watches by `singular` (e.g. `'user'`, `'address'`).
 * When a record of that resource is created, updated, or deleted, the server's
 * dispatcher (`packages/homestead-server/src/sync.ts`) fires the
 * lazily-imported handler **after** the write has committed, so the CRUD (or
 * user) call returns to the caller immediately and the mirror happens
 * out-of-band. A sync never blocks or fails the write it observes.
 *
 * Because it names the target resource at the app level rather than nesting on
 * a {@link ResourceDefinition}, a sync can watch the built-in `user` resource —
 * which no app owns a definition for, but which lives in the engine registry —
 * just as easily as an app-owned collection.
 *
 * **Semantics.** Best-effort and asynchronous: the dispatcher retries the
 * handler a small number of times with backoff, but there is no durable outbox
 * — if the process dies mid-retry the change is not replayed. Runs for the same
 * `(sync, resource, recordId)` are serialized so two rapid edits mirror in
 * order; different records run concurrently. The framework is agnostic about
 * how the external side maps ids: the **handler owns** the external-id mapping
 * and idempotency, so write handlers to tolerate being re-run for the same
 * change (an at-least-once delivery model).
 *
 * Every firing runs inside an AEP-151 **operation** — the dispatcher creates
 * one before invoking the handler and completes it (succeeded/failed)
 * afterwards — exactly like a cron firing, so each mirror leaves a persisted
 * record (status, timing, result, or error) in the `operations` collection,
 * visible in the Operations app.
 *
 * Handlers run without a user request, so the dispatcher mints a short-lived
 * admin bearer token per firing (like the boot-time schema sync and cron runs)
 * and hands it to the handler on {@link SyncContext.token}. Pair it with the
 * shared client (`serverClient(token)` from
 * `@rambleraptor/homestead-core/server/client`) to read engine data (e.g. to
 * resolve references) alongside the record snapshots the context already
 * carries.
 *
 * The handler is referenced through a lazy `import()` — the same convention as
 * cron handlers, migrations, and AEP-136 custom methods — so the server-only
 * code stays out of the client bundle. Keep handler modules under the app's
 * `syncs/` directory, or name them `*.server.ts`, so the production build stubs
 * them out of the browser bundle (see `packages/homestead-app/vite.config.ts`).
