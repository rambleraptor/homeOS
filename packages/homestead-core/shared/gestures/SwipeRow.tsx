/**
 * A list row that reveals an action when dragged sideways.
 *
 * The gesture every phone user already knows from Mail and Reminders: drag a
 * row aside, the action shows behind it, let go past the threshold and it
 * fires. On a list you work through one-handed — a shopping list, a todo list
 * — it removes the aim-at-a-small-target step that a row of icon buttons
 * demands.
 *
 * ## Swipe is always an accelerator, never the only route
 *
 * Every action offered here must also exist as a real button on the row.
 * Swipe is invisible, undiscoverable, and unavailable to anyone using a
 * keyboard or a screen reader — so the revealed panels are `aria-hidden` and
 * contribute nothing to the accessibility tree. Assistive tech sees the
 * buttons, which were already there. If you find yourself wanting to offer an
 * action *only* by swipe, add the button first.
 *
 * ## Not stealing the scroll
 *
 * The failure mode of a swipe list is that it fights the user's scrolling.
 * Two things prevent it here. `touch-action: pan-y` tells the browser it still
 * owns vertical panning and we only want horizontal, so scrolling stays on the
 * compositor and never waits on JavaScript. And a movement is not treated as a
 * swipe until it has travelled past a slop radius *and* is more horizontal
 * than vertical — before that it is nobody's gesture, and a mostly-vertical
 * drag is abandoned outright rather than competing.
