/**
 * Which collections the built-in household roles cover, and how.
 *
 * The seeded `admin` / `member` roles used to confer one `all`-scope grant —
 * "everything, forever". That blanket is what made a per-resource opt-out
 * necessary in the first place: a collection that wanted to be private had no
 * way to say "not me", so it said so in its definition instead. Enumerating the
 * roles removes the blanket, and with it the need for the opt-out.
 *
 * A household role covers a collection in one of two shapes:
 *   - **shared** — a plain collection grant. Every household member sees and
 *     edits every row. This is almost everything.
 *   - **own rows only** — the same grant carrying a `created_by == subject.id`
 *     filter, so a member may add rows and reach their own, but not anyone
 *     else's. Row visibility for the owner actually comes from `_owner`
 *     (owner ⇒ manage, engine-set and reliable even when `created_by` is
 *     absent); the filter's real job is to authorize CREATE without opening
 *     everyone else's rows.
 *
 * Privacy is therefore the shape of a grant. Which shape a collection gets is
 * declared by the resource itself (`ResourceDefinition.access`) and translated
 * here — so this module knows the *models*, never the app resources that use
 * them.
