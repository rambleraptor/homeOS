/**
 * The arithmetic behind the charitable tab, kept out of the hook so it can be
 * tested without React.
 *
 * Two rules do all the work here:
 *
 *   - **Which year a gift counts for** is its `tax_year` when the
 *     acknowledgment states one, and otherwise the year of its donation date.
 *     A check mailed on 30 December is deductible for the year it was sent even
 *     though the letter is dated January.
 *   - **What a gift is worth** is what you gave minus what you got back. A
 *     charity that hands you a $60 tote for a $250 gift has to say so, and only
 *     the $190 is deductible.
 *
 * A gift of goods nobody has valued yet contributes nothing — it is counted in
 * `unvalued` instead, so the number on the page is one you could defend rather
 * than one padded with blanks.
