 *
 * Lives under the Todos app, which owns the Today widget — see `useToday`.

 *   now     — happens today (or tonight): a birthday, bin night, a 2pm call.
 *   soon    — has a deadline close enough to act on: a perk about to expire.
 *   ambient — standing state with no deadline: the grocery list, open todos.
