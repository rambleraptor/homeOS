/**
 * The Events page: the household's yearly-recurring dates.
 *
 * It briefly grew a second tab, when reminders lived here and had enough volume
 * to need their own list. They don't live here any more — a reminder is a
 * `scheduled-notification` now, and the notifications app owns both what has
 * been delivered and what is queued. So this is one page again, which is what
 * it should have been the whole time: an events app that owns events.
 *
 * What events still contribute to reminders is `event-reminder`, the per-user
 * opt-in on each card, and the `events-materialize-reminders` cron that turns
 * those opt-ins into queued notifications. Neither needs a surface here beyond
 * the control on the event itself.
