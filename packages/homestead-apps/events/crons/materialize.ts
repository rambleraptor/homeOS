/**
 * `events-materialize-reminders` cron handler.
 *
 * Events used to push their own notifications: a daily 09:00 job scanned every
 * event, matched it against each user's `event-reminder` preference, and called
 * the push helper directly. That made "events" a second, parallel notification
 * pipeline next to reminders, with its own dedup rules and its own idea of what
 * time of day to interrupt someone.
 *
 * It no longer sends anything. Once a day it **materializes** the event
 * reminders that are coming up into scheduled notifications — stamped
 * `source_app: 'events'` — and the dispatcher delivers them like anything else
 * in the queue. One pipeline, one schedule, one inbox convention.
 *
 * **Reconciliation, not fire-and-forget.** Each run recomputes what the current
 * events and preferences imply for the next {@link HORIZON_DAYS} days, keyed by
 * `source_key` (`<event id>:<lead>:<occurrence year>`), and makes the stored
 * rows match: create what's missing, patch what drifted (an event renamed,
 * someone opting in or out), withdraw a future row nothing implies any more.
 * Rows already delivered — or cancelled by the person they were for — are left
 * alone until {@link PRUNE_AFTER_DAYS} sweeps them. Because the year is in the
 * key, next year's occurrence is a different row rather than a re-announce of
 * this year's.
 *
 * **Recipients.** An event reminder is per-user — one household member wants a
 * week's warning, another wants nothing — so the plan is fanned out to one row
 * per opted-in person. A scheduled notification is addressed by the user it is
 * parented under, which is why this works now and didn't before: the old
 * `reminder` rows were household-level and needed a `notify_users` field,
 * because a row a cron creates can't be *owned* by the person it's for.
 *
 * Server-only: lives under `crons/`, so vite stubs it out of the browser bundle.
