/**
 * Recipes "import from a URL" format.
 *
 * Server-only (under `methods/`, so the client build stubs it out) — which is
 * what makes this safe to build on: the fetch happens on the server, where the
 * SSRF fence in `safeFetchHtml` applies, rather than in a browser that could be
 * pointed anywhere.
 *
 * Declared as a `text` format because the framework's textarea is exactly the
 * right input: one URL per line imports a batch, and each URL becomes its own
 * selectable row in the preview. The extraction itself lives in
 * `../importers/urlImporter`, which never touches the network.
