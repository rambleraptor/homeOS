/**
 * A charity's receipt or acknowledgment letter for a donation.
 *
 * See form-1099-int.ts for the authoring notes; the same rules apply.
 *
 * Not an IRS form — a letter or receipt from the charity, so its wording varies
 * far more than a numbered-box form does. It earns its place because a gift of
 * $250 or more cannot be deducted without a written acknowledgment, and that
 * acknowledgment has to state whether anything was received in return, which is
 * why `goods_or_services` is extracted rather than assumed.
