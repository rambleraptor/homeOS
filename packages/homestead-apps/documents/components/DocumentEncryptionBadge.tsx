/**
 * Whether a document's stored file is encrypted at rest.
 *
 * The signal is per-document, not per-instance: turning encryption on encrypts
 * only new writes, so documents uploaded beforehand stay plaintext until they're
 * rewritten (see SECURITY.md). "Not encrypted" is styled as neutral information
 * rather than a warning — an operator may deliberately run without a master key.
