/**
 * `documents/{id}:classify` async custom method (AEP-136 + AEP-151).
 *
 * Reads the *stored* file rather than taking bytes in the body: the method is
 * item-scoped, so it has the record id and can pull the file back over loopback
 * with the caller's token (no need for the caller to base64 the bytes into the
 * request, as a collection-scoped method with no record yet would have to).
 *
 * Long-running: one vision call over a whole document is slow, so the call
 * returns 202 with an Operation and the work runs in the background. The
 * handler PATCHes the record itself — the operation records progress and
 * failure, it isn't the delivery mechanism.
 *
 * Preconditions live in `validate`, which runs before an Operation exists, so a
 * bad call gets a plain 4xx/503 rather than a 202 followed by a failed op.
 *
 * The body is normally empty — the method picks the type itself. A caller may
 * pass `{ "doc_type": "<id>" }` to *force* that type: pass 1 is skipped and only
 * the extraction pass runs, so a human's authoritative choice still gets its
 * fields AI-filled. See `./forced-type`.

  return `You are reading a scanned or digital household document. Do two things.

1. Write a short, human-readable "title" for the document — what a person would
   name this file so they could find it later.

   Follow one shape: "<Document> — <Subject>". Name the kind of document, then an
   em dash surrounded by spaces (" — "), then the specific person, business,
   issuer, or item it concerns. When the document is tied to a single year (a tax
   form, an annual statement), put that year in parentheses right after the
   document name: "<Document> (<Year>) — <Subject>".

   Match these examples in form and tone:
   - 1099-INT (2024) — Pecan Street Credit Union
   - 1098 (2024) — Lone Star Mortgage
   - Donation Statement (2024) — Central Texas Food Bank
   - Auto Insurance — 2019 Honda Civic
   - Business Owner's Policy — Rivera Design Co
   - Certificate of Marriage — Dana & Sam Rivera
   - Driver's License — Mateo Rivera
   - Apple — Studio Display
   - B&H Photo — 50mm Lens

   Rules:
   - Left of the dash is what the document *is*: the form number, certificate
     name, or policy type — or, for a receipt or invoice, the vendor. Right of the
     dash is who or what it concerns: the issuer, the named person, the insured
     asset, or the purchased item.
   - Use the document's own specifics. Never fall back on generic words like
     "Scan", "Document", "Statement", or "Untitled" on their own.
   - Title Case throughout. No file extension, no surrounding quotes, no trailing
     period. Keep it under about eight words.
   - Drop the dash and the second half only when the document truly has no
     distinct subject.

2. Decide whether it is one of these known document types:

${catalogue || '(no known document types are configured)'}

   Set "doc_type" to the matching id. If it is not clearly one of them, set
   "doc_type" to "${UNKNOWN_DOC_TYPE}". Many documents legitimately match
   nothing — "${UNKNOWN_DOC_TYPE}" is a normal answer, not a failure, and is far
   better than forcing a wrong match.

Also set "confidence" between 0 and 1: how sure you are of the type match. Use a
low value when the document is blurry, cropped, or only loosely resembles a known
type.`;
}

/**
 * The extraction pass runs only after {@link classifyPrompt} has matched a
 * single type, so it names that type and asks for its fields alone — a small,
