/**
 * Backfill `document.people` from the names each document already extracted.
 *
 * The `people` link is new; existing documents have it empty even though their
 * doc-type metadata already names people (a receipt's patient, a W-2's
 * employee). This seeds the stored link once from that derived data, so a
 * person's detail page isn't empty on day one — resolving each extracted name to
 * a directory id exactly as `classify` now does for new uploads.
 *
 * Idempotent: a document that already carries a non-empty `people` list is left
 * untouched (a resumed or re-run pass never clobbers a value classify or a human
 * has since set), and a document whose names resolve to nobody is skipped.
