/**
 * `home-task-reminders` cron handler.
 *
 * The upkeep list knows what the house needs and when — this turns the next
 * {@link HORIZON_DAYS} days of it into queued notifications, and the
 * dispatcher delivers them. One notification per task per due date, sent the
 * morning of the reminder (`next_due` minus the task's own `lead_days`, so
 * "book the gutter people two weeks out" and "change the filter today" can
 * live on the same list).
 *
 * The notification carries the task's `notes` verbatim. That is the whole point
 * of the field: the reminder arrives while you're standing at the hardware
 * store, and "20x25x1, MERV 11" in the body beats a link you have to open.
 *
 * Opt-in per person (`task_reminder`, declared in `../app.config.ts`), like bin
 * night: the schedule is household data anyone can edit, but an interruption
 * belongs to whoever asked for it. The plan is fanned out to one queued
 * notification per opted-in person; with nobody opted in, no rows are written.
 *
 * **Overdue tasks are chased once a day.** A task whose date has passed is
 * still the thing you meant to do, so its reminder moves to the next morning
 * slot ahead rather than being written into the past, where the dispatcher
 * could only mark it missed — and because the source key carries the chase
 * date, each day's nudge is its own row rather than a rewrite of the one that
 * already went out. That's deliberate: an unattended gutter should keep asking.
 *
 * Idempotent by `source_key` (`task:<id>:<due date>[:<chase date>]`); see
 * `reconcileScheduled`.
 *
 * Server-only: lives under `crons/`, so vite stubs it out of the browser bundle.
