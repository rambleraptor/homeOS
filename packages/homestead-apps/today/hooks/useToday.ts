/**
 * Assembles the Today card from the apps that already own the data.
 *
 * This app stores nothing. Every line comes from a sibling app's existing hook,
 * which is the whole point: Today is a *view*, and a second copy of "what is
 * happening" would be a second thing to keep correct.
 *
 * On calling every hook unconditionally: React's rules require it, and it costs
 * nothing in practice — each of these queries is already mounted by the sibling
 * widget on the same dashboard (Groceries, Todos, Upcoming perks, Upcoming
 * events, Next pickup), so React Query serves them from one cache entry rather
 * than issuing a second request. Lanes for apps this viewer can't see are
 * dropped after the fact, exactly as the dashboard already drops their widgets.
