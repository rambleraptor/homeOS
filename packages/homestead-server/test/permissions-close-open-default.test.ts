/**
 * The `permissions-close-open-default` migration, end to end against a real
 * engine.
 *
 * The migration is the bridge between two worlds: instances seeded before the
 * closed-by-default change carry an `everyone → write on *` grant that *is* every
 * ungrouped user's access, so it can't simply be deleted. These cases pin the
 * three behaviors that make removing it safe:
 *
 *   1. an ungrouped user is moved onto the Member role before the grant goes, so
 *      their effective access is unchanged;
 *   2. a user who already has an admin-chosen role is left exactly as they are;
 *   3. with people to park and nowhere to put them, the grant is *kept* and the
 *      handler throws — a household is never locked out of its own data, and a
 *      bail recorded as `succeeded` would never retry;
 *   4. with nobody to park, a missing Members group is irrelevant and the grant
 *      goes anyway — the case that left a real household open.
 *
 * The handler builds its own client through `serverClient`, which targets
 * `AEPBASE_URL`, so these stub `globalThis.fetch` to route that origin at the
 * in-process engine. In a running server the `/api/aep` gateway does this.
