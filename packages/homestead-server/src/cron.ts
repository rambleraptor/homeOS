/**
 * Cron scheduler — runs the periodic hooks apps declare via `AppConfig.crons`.
 *
 * On boot, `startServer` hands the aggregated hook list (from the app
 * registry's `getAllCronHooks`) to {@link startCronScheduler}, which sets up
 * one timer per hook — a fixed-cadence `setInterval` for an `intervalSeconds`
 * hook, or a self-rearming `setTimeout` aimed at the next local `dailyAtHour`
 * for a daily hook (see {@link nextDailyFire}). Each firing mints a short-lived admin bearer
 * token in the server's own db — the same mechanism the boot-time schema sync
 * uses — invokes the lazily-imported handler with it, and revokes the token
 * when the handler settles.
 *
 * Every firing runs inside an AEP-151 operation (via the injected
 * {@link OperationStore}): the scheduler creates one before the handler runs
 * and completes it afterwards, so each run leaves a persisted record — status,
 * timing, and the handler's result or error — in the `operations` collection.
 * That's the built-in logging cron jobs get for free. Creating the operation is
 * best-effort: if it fails (e.g. the schema isn't synced yet at boot), the
 * handler still runs so the work isn't skipped.
 *
 * A hook that is still running when its next tick arrives is skipped for that
 * tick (no overlapping runs of the same hook), and a handler that throws is
 * logged and swallowed so a single bad run can't take the process down.
 *
 * Each firing runs through the shared {@link operationRunner}, the same
 * process-wide concurrency pool every other operation uses, so cron work
 * competes for the same `HOMESTEAD_MAX_OPERATIONS` slots instead of being
 * treated separately.
 *
 * Timers are `unref`'d: cron work should never keep the process alive on its
 * own — the HTTP listener does that — so shutdown and short-lived tools/tests
 * aren't blocked by a pending interval.
