/**
 * Translating a derived-surface call into the typed call it stands for.
 *
 * Both the `resource` and `generic` surfaces (see `./surface`) are re-shapings
 * of the same underlying operations, not reimplementations of them: a call is
 * flattened into exactly the arguments the corresponding typed tool takes,
 * validated against *that tool's own* Zod schema, and handed to
 * `executeToolCall` / `executeCustomMethod`. Keeping that step here means the
 * two surfaces cannot drift from each other or from `typed`, and that a
 * rejection is worded the same way wherever it comes from.
 *
 * The wording matters as much as the validation. A derived surface takes its
 * record body as one opaque object, so the model cannot read requiredness off
 * the schema the way it can on the typed surface — every rejection therefore
 * names what *was* accepted, so a wrong guess self-corrects in one round-trip
 * instead of dead-ending.
