/**
 * The contract the non-typed MCP tool surfaces share.
 *
 * `/api/mcp` can serve its tools three ways (see
 * `docs/design/mcp-tool-surfaces.md`):
 *
 *  - `typed`    — four tools per resource plus one per custom method. Richest
 *                 provider-side schemas, ~167 tools on a stock instance.
 *  - `resource` — one tool per resource, the verb as an `action` parameter
 *                 (`./per-resource`). ~41 tools, each carrying its own
 *                 resource's real field schema, emitted once instead of twice.
 *  - `generic`  — six resource-parameterized tools (`./generic`). Flattest and
 *                 cheapest; field schemas only on request.
 *
 * `typed` registers straight onto the MCP server from `buildTools`, so it has
 * no surface object. The other two are *derived* surfaces: they translate a
 * call back into the typed call it stands for and hand it to the same
 * executors, so permissions, reference checks, list caps, and custom-method
 * dispatch behave identically no matter which surface a client sees. Both
 * therefore produce the same shape, described here, and `./register` registers
 * either through one loop.
