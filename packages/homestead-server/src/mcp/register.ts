/**
 * Registers Homestead's tools on an MCP server. This is the MCP analog of the
 * tool-wiring loop in `core/server/chat/handler.ts`: it reuses the exact same
 * `buildTools` / `executeToolCall` / `makeSearchTool` machinery the AI chat
 * uses, so the CRUD surface and the chat surface stay identical by construction.
 * On top of those it registers one tool per app-declared AEP-136 custom method
 * (see `./custom-methods`), which the chat has no equivalent of — an MCP client
 * would otherwise be limited to plain CRUD.
 *
 * That is the `typed` surface. Two derived surfaces re-shape the same
 * operations for clients that can't hold ~167 tools — `./per-resource` (one
 * tool per resource, verb as a parameter) and `./generic` (six
 * resource-parameterized tools). Both produce the shape described in
 * `./surface`, so this module registers either through one loop and the choice
 * costs a single branch. Which one a request gets is the `settings` app's
 * `mcp_tools` flag, read by the route.
 *
 * Tools bind to a single caller's token, so this runs once per request (the
 * route builds a fresh McpServer each time), mirroring how `handleChat`
 * rebuilds tools per request.
